  createInterviewController; route and employee routes for form selector.
- Candidate.findOne includes interviews on applications for list refresh.
- Unit tests for controller and service (create flow).

- Create interview form in CandidateDetails: application, interview step,
  employee, date (default today/now), result (default Pending), score, notes.
- interviewService.createInterview; form validation and success/error handling.
