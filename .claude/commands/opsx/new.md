Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:new` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

   Use the default schema (omit `--schema`) unless the user explicitly requests a different workflow.

   **Use a different schema only if the user mentions:**
   - A specific schema name → use `--schema <name>`
   - "show workflows" or "what workflows" → run `openspec schemas --json` and let them choose

   **Otherwise**: Omit `--schema` to use the default.

3. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   Add `--schema <name>` only if the user requested a specific workflow.
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with the selected schema.

3.5. **Handle attached files (if any)**
   If the user has attached files to this conversation:
   - Check for any files in the conversation context (attached files will be visible in the file list)
   - For each attached file:
     - Read the file to get its current path
     - Move it to the root of the change directory: `openspec/changes/<name>/<filename>`
     - Use the file system tools to copy/move the file, preserving the original filename
   - If files were moved, inform the user: "Moved N attached file(s) to the change directory root."

4. **Show the artifact status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```
   This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema. Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   ```bash
   openspec instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   ```
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Run `/opsx:continue` or just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest using `/opsx:continue` instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow
