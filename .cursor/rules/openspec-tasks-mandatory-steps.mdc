# OpenSpec Tasks: Mandatory Steps Enforcement

When creating or updating `tasks.md` artifacts in OpenSpec changes, you MUST:

## 1. Read openspec/config.yaml First

**BEFORE** creating or updating any `tasks.md` file, you MUST read `openspec/config.yaml` to understand:
- Backend-specific mandatory steps
- Branch naming conventions
- Task structure requirements
- Testing and documentation requirements

## 2. Mandatory Steps for Backend Changes

All backend implementation tasks MUST include these steps in the correct order:

### Step 0: Create Feature Branch (MUST BE FIRST)
- **Location**: Must be the very first step (Step 0)
- **Branch naming**: `feature/[ticket-id]-backend` or `feature/[change-name]-backend`
- **Action**: Create and switch to feature branch before any code changes

### Mandatory Steps (Must Be Included):
- **Step N**: Review and Update Existing Unit Tests (MANDATORY)
- **Step N+1**: Run Unit Tests and Verify Database State (MANDATORY)
- **Step N+2**: Manual Endpoint Testing with curl (MANDATORY) - **AGENT MUST EXECUTE**
- **Step N+3**: E2E Testing with Playwright MCP (MANDATORY if applicable) - **AGENT MUST EXECUTE**
- **Step N+4**: Update Technical Documentation (MANDATORY)

## 3. Manual Testing Requirements - CRITICAL: Agent Must Execute

**IMPORTANT**: The coding agent (AI) MUST perform all manual testing steps itself. **NEVER delegate testing to the user**. These tests must be executed by the agent to mark tasks as completed in `tasks.md`.

### Step N+2: Manual Endpoint Testing with curl (MANDATORY)

**Agent Responsibility**: The coding agent MUST execute all curl commands and verify responses. This is NOT optional and cannot be delegated to the user.

**Implementation Steps** (Agent must perform):
1. **Prepare Test Environment**:
   - Ensure the backend server is running (start if needed)
   - Verify database connection is active
   - Note the current database state (if testing CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE endpoints)

2. **Test GET Endpoints** (if any):
   - Create curl command to test GET endpoint
   - Execute curl command: `curl -X GET [endpoint-url] [headers]`
   - Verify response status code (200, 404, etc.)
   - Verify response body structure and content
   - Document the curl command and response in the task completion

3. **Test POST Endpoints** (CREATE operations):
   - Create curl command with request body: `curl -X POST [endpoint-url] -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[json-body]'`
   - Execute curl command and capture response
   - Verify response status code (201, 400, 422, etc.)
   - Verify response body contains created resource
   - **Restore Database State**: After testing, delete the created record to restore database to original state
   - Document the curl command, response, and cleanup action

4. **Test PUT/PATCH Endpoints** (UPDATE operations):
   - Create curl command with updated data: `curl -X PUT [endpoint-url] -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[json-body]'`
   - Execute curl command and capture response
   - Verify response status code (200, 404, 400, etc.)
   - Verify response body contains updated resource
   - **Restore Database State**: After testing, revert the updated record to its original values to restore database state
   - Document the curl command, response, and cleanup action

5. **Test DELETE Endpoints**:
   - Create curl command: `curl -X DELETE [endpoint-url]`
   - Execute curl command and capture response
   - Verify response status code (200, 204, 404, etc.)
   - Verify deletion was successful
   - **Restore Database State**: After testing, recreate the deleted record with original values to restore database state
   - Document the curl command, response, and cleanup action

6. **Test Error Cases**:
   - Test with invalid data (validation errors)
   - Test with non-existent resources (404 errors)
   - Test with unauthorized access (if applicable)
   - Verify error response format matches API specification

7. **Mark Task as Completed**: Only after all curl tests pass and database state is restored, mark the task as completed in `tasks.md`

**Dependencies**:
- Backend server running (agent must start if needed)
- Database access for state restoration
- curl command-line tool

**Notes**:
- This step is MANDATORY for all new endpoints
- **The agent MUST execute all curl commands itself** - never ask the user to run tests
- All CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operations must restore database to original state after testing
- Document all curl commands and responses for future reference
- Verify that database state matches pre-test state after cleanup
- Do not skip manual testing even if unit tests pass
- **Task completion in tasks.md can only be marked after successful execution of all curl tests**

### Step N+3: E2E Testing with Playwright MCP (MANDATORY if applicable)

**Agent Responsibility**: The coding agent MUST execute all E2E tests using Playwright MCP tools. This is NOT optional and cannot be delegated to the user.

**When This Applies**:
- Frontend changes that affect user workflows
- Integration between frontend and backend endpoints
- User-facing features that require browser interaction

**Implementation Steps** (Agent must perform):
1. **Prepare Test Environment**:
   - Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running (start if needed)
   - Verify database is in a known state
   - Check available Playwright MCP tools using MCP file system

2. **Navigate to Application**:
   - Use Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` to open the application URL
   - Wait for page to load completely
   - Take a snapshot to verify initial state

3. **Execute User Workflows**:
   - Use Playwright MCP tools to interact with the UI:
     - `browser_click` for button clicks and navigation
     - `browser_type` or `browser_fill` for form inputs
     - `browser_snapshot` to verify state changes
     - `browser_wait` for async operations
   - Test the complete user workflow from start to finish
   - Verify expected outcomes at each step

4. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Test form validation errors
   - Test error messages display correctly
   - Test error recovery flows

5. **Verify Data Persistence**:
   - After creating/updating data through UI, verify it persists correctly
   - Check database state matches UI state
   - Verify data appears correctly in lists/details views

6. **Restore Test Environment**:
   - Clean up any test data created during E2E tests
   - Restore database to original state
   - Close browser sessions

7. **Mark Task as Completed**: Only after all E2E tests pass and environment is restored, mark the task as completed in `tasks.md`

**Dependencies**:
- Frontend server running (agent must start if needed)
- Backend server running (agent must start if needed)
- Playwright MCP tools available
- Database access for verification and cleanup

**Notes**:
- **The agent MUST execute all E2E tests itself** - never ask the user to run tests
- Use incremental waits (1-3 seconds) with snapshot checks rather than long waits
- Always restore database state after tests that modify data
- Document test scenarios and outcomes
- **Task completion in tasks.md can only be marked after successful execution of all E2E tests**

## 4. Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any `tasks.md` file, verify:
- [ ] Step 0 (Create Feature Branch) is the FIRST step
- [ ] All mandatory steps from config.yaml are included
- [ ] Steps are numbered sequentially
- [ ] Mandatory steps are clearly marked with "(MANDATORY)" label
- [ ] Branch naming follows the convention: `feature/[name]-backend`
- [ ] Manual testing steps explicitly state "AGENT MUST EXECUTE"
- [ ] Tasks include database state restoration steps
- [ ] E2E testing step is included if frontend changes are involved

## 5. When This Applies

This rule applies when:
- Creating `tasks.md` via `/opsx:ff` (fast-forward)
- Creating `tasks.md` via `/opsx:continue` (continue change)
- Updating existing `tasks.md` files
- Any task creation that involves backend changes
- Implementing tasks from `tasks.md` - the agent must execute manual tests

## 7. Agent Execution Requirements

**CRITICAL**: When implementing tasks from `tasks.md`, the coding agent MUST:

1. **Execute All Manual Tests**: Never ask the user to run curl commands or E2E tests. The agent must:
   - Start servers if needed (backend, frontend)
   - Execute all curl commands for endpoint testing
   - Execute all E2E tests using Playwright MCP tools
   - Verify all responses and outcomes
   - Restore database state after tests

2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can ONLY be marked as completed (`[x]`) in `tasks.md` AFTER:
   - The agent has successfully executed all required tests
   - All test results have been verified
   - Database state has been restored (for CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE operations)
   - All test outcomes have been documented

3. **Never Delegate Testing**: The agent must never:
   - Ask the user to run curl commands
   - Ask the user to test endpoints manually
   - Ask the user to run E2E tests
   - Mark tasks as completed without executing tests
   - Skip manual testing steps

4. **Document Test Execution**: The agent must document:
   - All curl commands executed
   - All responses received
   - All E2E test scenarios executed
   - Database state restoration actions
   - Any issues encountered and resolutions

## Failure to Follow

If you create tasks without following these mandatory steps, the user will need to manually fix the tasks.md file. Always read `openspec/config.yaml` first and ensure all mandatory steps are included.

**If you implement tasks without executing manual tests yourself, you are violating this rule. The agent must execute all tests to mark tasks as completed.**
